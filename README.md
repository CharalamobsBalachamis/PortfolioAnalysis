# PortfolioAnalysis
In this project I analysed the performance of my own stock portfolio using R's PerformanceAnalytics package,
I accurately weighted the stocks according to the percentage of the total portfolio they constitute 
And realised through the analysis that I am not the stock market prodigy I thought I was.
